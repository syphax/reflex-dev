---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Future Enhancement Markers)
- [ ] Add capacity constraints framework (building size/throughput)
- [ ] Implement inbound node capacity limits (ports/factories)
- [ ] Create parcel carrier (UPS/FedEx) cost/speed modeling framework
- [ ] Build multi-product support (up to 1000s of products)
- [ ] Add cloud database migration pathway
- [ ] Implement OpenStreetMap integration for facility discovery

## Current Goal
**Phase 3 enhancements complete!** ✅ Demand system refactored:
- Removed facility assignment from demand (model determines it)
- Added demand set management (create/save/load/delete)
- Added default ZIP3 demand based on 2020 census population
- Fixed sidebar resize toggle

**Phase 5 nearly complete!** ✅ Tasks 1-4 done. Remaining: Flow visualization and parquet file persistence

## Recent Changes

### Demand System Refactor (Phase 3 Enhancement)
- **Removed facility assignment from demand definition** - Demand points now only contain ZIP code, product ID, and units demanded. The simulation/optimization algorithms dynamically assign demand to facilities.
- **Added DemandSetState** - New state manager for creating, saving, loading, and deleting named demand sets
- **Demand Set UI** - New "Demand Sets" section in Demand tab with:
  - Dropdown to select current demand set
  - Save/Delete buttons for current set
  - Create new demand set input and button
  - "Load Default ZIP3 Demand" button
- **Default ZIP3 Demand** - Pre-populated demand set with major US ZIP3 codes based on 2020 census population (formula: ceil(population / 1000))
- **Updated simulation logic** - Now assigns demand to nearest active facility automatically during simulation
- **Fixed sidebar resize toggle** - Restore visibility and functionality of the chevron button to expand/collapse sidebar

### Data Structure Changes
- **Demand TypedDict** - Removed `assigned_facility_id` field (now: demand_id, zip_code, product_id, units_demanded)
- **DemandSet TypedDict** - New structure for saving demand configurations (name, demands list)
- **Simulation assignment** - Dynamic facility assignment based on Haversine distance to nearest active facility

## Data Schemas (Implemented)

### Facilities
- facility_id, facility_type, site_name, parent_company, street_address, city, state_province, zip5, zip9, country, latitude, longitude, is_active, capacity_cuft, capacity_weight_lbs

### Products  
- product_id, product_name, cost_per_unit, price_per_unit, weight_per_unit, weight_unit, cube_per_unit, cube_unit

### Demand (UPDATED)
- demand_id, zip_code, product_id, units_demanded
- **Removed:** assigned_facility_id (now calculated by simulation)

### Demand Sets (NEW)
- name (string), demands (list of Demand objects)

### Transport Costs
- mode (Parcel/LTL/TL), cost_per_mile

### Truck Capacity
- max_volume_cuft, max_weight_lbs

### Inbound Sources (Top 25 US Ports)
